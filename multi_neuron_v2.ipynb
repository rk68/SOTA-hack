        "A dose-response relationship study for edrophonium to examine the modification of volatile anaesthetics on reversal of vecuronium block. One hundred and twenty ASA (I-II) patients were anaesthetized with sevoflurane, isoflurane (1 minimum alveolar anaesthetic concentration [MAC] end-tidal concentration), or fentanyl-diazepam anaesthesia, in combination with 66% nitrous oxide (n = 40 for each group). The evoked electromyogram (EMG) response of the abductor digiti minimi was monitored at 20 sec intervals following train-of-four (TOF) stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The initial neuromuscular block was produced by vecuronium 100 micrograms.kg-1. When the amplitude of the first response (T1) had spontaneously recovered to 10% of the control, edrophonium (0, 125, 400, 700 or 1000 micrograms.kg-1; eight patients each) was randomly administered, and the ratio of the fourth TOF to the first response (TOFR) was monitored at one minute intervals for 10 min. Sevoflurane and isoflurane impaired the edrophonium-assisted TOFR recovery in an edrophonium dose and time dependent manner. The dose-response curves at 10 min exhibited a greater shift to the right in the sevoflurane and isoflurane groups than in the fentanyl-diazepam-nitrous oxide group (P < 0.05). Higher ED50 values (the edrophonium dose required to obtain TOFR value of 50%) in the sevoflurane (> 1000 micrograms.kg-1) and isoflurane groups (851 micrograms.kg-1) were observed than in the fentanyl-diazepam-nitrous oxide group (339 micrograms.kg-1) (P < 0.05).

        "Pseudorandom single photon counting is a novel time-resolved optical measurement method, which is advantageous over convention techniques in terms of data-acquisition speed and system cost. As a critical component of the pseudorandom single photon counter, the photon arriving time digitizer should be storage efficient for a high photon counting rate, while maintaining good time accuracy. We report an ultra storage-efficient time digitizer for a pseudorandom single photon counter in this paper, which is based on the asynchronous serial communication and can store the arriving time of every photon in 1-b memory space. In addition, a novel comb-wave modulator is proposed to achieve the dc balance required for asynchronous serial communication. Our prototype implemented on field-programmable gate arrays provides a time resolution of 400 ps. It can register up to 4.2-Giga photon arriving time tags with 1024 × 32-b memory space.<|endoftext|>I didn't wear my Veronica Mars T-shirt to interview Jason Dohring, but the thought did briefly cross my mind.

        "Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Angiogenesis is critical in the pathogenesis of PMF. We studied angiogenesis in 115 patients with CMD (23 PV, 24 ET, 46 PMF, 12 post-PV and 10 post-ET myelofibrosis) by assessment of microvessel density (MVD) in bone marrow (BM). Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance showed that patients with PMF had significantly higher values of MVD than those with PV (P < 0.001), ET (P < 0.001) and controls (P < 0.001). Mann-Whitney U-test demonstrated that patients with PMF at the prefibrotic stage had significantly higher MVD values than those with ET (P = 0.02). Patients with post-PV myelofibrosis showed significantly higher MVD values than those with PV (P < 0.001), as did patients with post-ET myelofibrosis compared with ET (P < 0.001). In patients with CMD, the multivariate generalized linear regression model showed that the JAK2 (V617F) mutational burden (P = 0.01), serum lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0.003), and anaemia (P < 0.001) independently correlated with MVD. In summary, this study indicates that assessment of BM angiogenesis, as measured by MVD, may be a useful additional tool in the histopathological definition of CMD.<|endoftext|>Microfabrication conventionally uses photolithography or optical lithography processes for selectively removing parts of a substrate, or parts of a material layer on the substrate. For example, photolithography uses a directed light (radiation) source to transfer a pattern from a photomask (also referred to as a mask or reticle) to a light-sensitive resist material formed on the substrate or material layer, thereby generating an exposure pattern in the resist material. Chemical treatments may then be used to etch or otherwise transfer the exposure pattern in the resist material to the substrate or material layer. More recently, microfabrication has implemented other lithography types, such as charged particle beam lithography, that do not necessitate the intermediary step of creating the mask to transfer or generate an exposure pattern in a resist material. For example, electron beam (e-beam) lithography uses a focused beam of electrons to expose the resist material. Instead of using a mask, e-beam lithography “writes” a pattern directly into an energy-sensitive resist material\n",

Intestinal perfusion was performed in vivo for evaluation of water and electrolyte transports. Methotrexate-treated rats lost a significant amount of weight and presented a marked reduction in food intake. Methotrexate induced significant and dose-dependent villous atrophy and elongation of crypts in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Methotrexate also induced an increase in sodium and potassium secretion and an important reduction of the mucosa absorptive surface area, shown by the decrease in the mannitol excretion ratio.

        "A comparison of viable areas of axial pattern flaps post inset was made between expanded and non-expanded pig buttock island flaps. The deep circumflex iliac artery and vein supply approximately the proximal 14 x 10 cm area of this flap. Larger flaps were raised on expanded and control sides of eight pigs to determine if expansion increased the area of survival. In six of eight pigs whose initial tissue expansion did not create more than approximately a 50% increase in skin area, the expanded flaps had a statistically significant increase in viable skin area (proportionally) 10 days post inset than their control flaps (p less than 0.05). Two other pigs did not conform to this pattern.

        "Cognitive models for developmental dyslexia are nowadays centered on the hypothesis of a specific deficit within the phonologic module of the language system. To ascertain whether defects of spatial cognition are associated with developmental reading disability, we investigated a sample of 43 school children (aged 8-9 years) found to be reading impaired during a wide screening survey for developmental dyslexia in the province of Naples, Italy. After one year all children were tested again and only 9/43 still presented reading impairment, while the remaining had achieved a variable range of spontaneous recovery. A detailed analysis was performed on all children to characterize their cognitive performances using on one hand classical conventional tests for constructional praxis, visuospatial cognition, and visuospatial memory and on the other a specific neuropsychological battery for constructional disorders. The results of our study demonstrated that children with long-lasting reading impairment exhibited normal performances on spatial cognition tasks. Moreover, one single child was found with relevant visuospatial deficits pointing to the possible existence of a visuospatial subtype for developmental dyslexia.<|endoftext|>Venice, Day 2\n",
